HOW TO BUILD

  One may use "build.xml" in the root of this repository to build the project
  with Ant (the original jar was built with Ant 1.8.2). This one implements
  the following targets:
    - clean (removes "build" and "jar" directories);
    - compile (compiles source code from "src" directory in "build/classes",
      please note that main class is to be specified in manifest tag to make
      the library runnable);
    - jar (creates library's jar file "jar/ezze-utils-x.y.z.jar");
    - run (starts library "jar/ezze-utils-x.y.z.jar" if main class was
      specified during the compilation);
    - debug (debugs a project using NetBeans debugger);
    - javadoc (generates project's javadoc in "javadoc" directory).
      
  "x.y.z" is a current version of the library defined by library.version
  property of "src/ezze/utils/resources/ezze-utils.properties" file.

  Please note that JDK6 (Java Development Kit 6) is required for the build.
  
  I tried to comment the code as good as possible so you can find more
  information right in source code or in "javadoc" directory.
